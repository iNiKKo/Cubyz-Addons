## Uploading for the First Time

You can easily submit your addon using the **CubyzHub uploader**.  
Just click the **Upload** button next to the CubyzHub title.  
This will open the upload page where you can fill in your addon’s details and upload your files.

**Upload your addon here:**  
[Addon Uploader](https://addons.ashframe.net/upload.html)

Once submitted, your addon will be automatically added to the site after review.

## Updating an Existing Addon

Currently, updating addons **through the web uploader is not supported**.  
To update your addon, you’ll need to manually:

1. Edit the main `addons.json` file to update your addon’s version or details.  
2. Replace, update or add new screenshots or other can be done via your addon’s folder in the repository.

> This limitation will be removed in a future update once the uploader supports version updates.
